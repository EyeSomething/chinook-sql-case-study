# Chinook SQLite Case Study
## Introduction

This case study uses the Chinook SQLite database, a dataset that simulates a digital music store similar to early versions of iTunes. It includes tables for customers, employees, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, genres, and playlists.

The goal is to practice beginner-level SQL concepts by exploring real relational data. All work is performed using the SQLite database engine, and queries can be executed using DBEAVER or any other SQLite client.

## Database Overview

The schema includes several connected entities. The main relationships are:

### Sales and Customers

A Customer is supported by an Employee.

A Customer creates Invoices.

Each Invoice contains multiple InvoiceLine records.

### Music Catalog

An Artist has many Albums.

An Album contains Tracks.

A Track belongs to a Genre and a MediaType.

### Playlists

A Playlist contains Tracks through the PlaylistTrack link table.

These relationships allow analysis of customers, sales, music inventory, and playlist activity.

## Objectives

This case study focuses on developing understanding of:

Basic SQL syntax

Querying and filtering data

Sorting results

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

JOIN operations

Grouping and summarizing

Understanding a relational database schema

The case study is designed for beginners and simulates practical questions a junior analyst may receive.

Identify which employee supports the most customers.

Find customers who created more than five invoices.

### C. Sales Insights

Calculate total revenue generated by the store.

Calculate revenue by billing country.

Display revenue trends by month and year.

Calculate the average invoice total.

### D. Music Insights

List the top 10 bestselling tracks by quantity sold.

Identify the top 5 artists by total revenue.

Determine the most popular genre based on tracks sold.

Find which media type produces the most revenue.

### E. Playlist Insights

Determine which playlist has the highest total duration (in milliseconds).

### F. Summary

Write a short summary describing key findings from the analysis.
